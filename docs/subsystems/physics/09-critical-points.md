## Critical Points

- **NEVER** convert Y coordinates
- Calculate `penetrationDepth` BEFORE hard clipping (ground)
- Mass matters for StaticEntity (no infinite mass)
- **4 correction passes** in priority order (Boundaries → Ground → StaticEntity → Node↔Node)
- **Scenes integration**: Scene graph Nodes inherit MovableTrait for physics
- **Spatial octree**: Scene owns Octree for physics broad-phase
