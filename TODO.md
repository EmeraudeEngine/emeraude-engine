# Bugs and TODO-list
- GENERAL: Remove all invalid noexcept keyword. (WIP)
- GENERAL: Increase inlining. (WIP)
- GENERAL: Improve functions args to use "std::move" when useful.
- GENERAL: Rewrite libs Observer/Observable pattern with the idea of static and shared objects.
- GENERAL: Replace all "std::stringstream" by "std::format" (C++20) for simple keys, names or identifiers creation. WARNING: This doesn't work under macOS for targeting older SDKs.
- GENERAL: Issue on Linux with X11, multi-monitors and NVIDIA proprietary driver. More info: https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/external-monitor-freezes-when-using-dedicated-gpu/265406
- RENDERING SYSTEM: Improve the rendering branches to reduce cost.
- RENDERING SYSTEM: Check sprite blending.
- RENDERING SYSTEM: Check sprite texture clamping to edges.
- PHYSICS SYSTEM: Enable the rotational physics. (WIP)
- PHYSICS SYSTEM: Create a particle system using Compute Shader.
- RESOURCES SYSTEM: Merge Font from PixelFactory and FontResource.
- RESOURCES SYSTEM: Check the direct data description with the JSON resource description.
- RESOURCES SYSTEM: Check the store resource addition from the JSON resource description. (WIP)
- RESOURCES SYSTEM: Determine a native 3D format for loading speedup.
- OVERLAY SYSTEM: Rework ComposedSurface from overlay to create a native menu.
- OVERLAY SYSTEM: Rewrite the TextWriter class.
- SCENE SYSTEM: Create a shared dynamic uniform buffer for static entities instead of using push_constants as they normally won't move between frames. Thus, it will only hold the model matrix.
- ANIMATION SYSTEM: Check all animatable properties for all objects.
- ANIMATION SYSTEM: Remove Variant for "std::any"
- CONSOLE SYSTEM: Bring back a useful console behavior.
- LIGHTING AND SHADOWING: Fix the ambient light update against the render target which uses it.
- LIGHTING AND SHADOWING: Re-enable the ambient light color generated by the averaging active light color.
- LIGHTING AND SHADOWING: Check the ambient light color generated by a texture.
- LIGHTING AND SHADOWING: Check what the light matrix for a shadow map is and how to update it. Hint, this is an MVP matrix from the light point of view.
- LIGHTING AND SHADOWING: Check light radius against entities to discard some useless rendering.
- LIGHTING AND SHADOWING: Shadow maps: Create a re-usable shadow map for ephemere lights.
- SHADERS CODE GENERATION: Check source and binary caches.
- SHADERS CODE GENERATION: Prepare a way to use manual GLSL sources.
- SHADERS CODE GENERATION: Re-enable normal calculation bypass when the surface is not facing a light.
- SHADERS CODE GENERATION: Re-enable shadow maps. Depends on the offscreen rendering completion, but most of the code is done. (WIP)
- MATERIAL: Create a shared dynamic uniform buffer when a material does not use sampler. EDIT: Pay attention to the real benefit of that solution.
- MATERIAL: Create a material editor in JavaScript (application side). EDIT: Should be a tool for the engine.
- GEOMETRY: Finish 3D formats loading/reading.
- GEOMETRY: Check geometry primitive generation with all basic attributes.
- VULKAN: Find a better way to detect the UBO max capacity. For now the limit is hard-coded to 65,536 bytes.
- VULKAN: Implement VK_KHR_synchronization2 and VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering from Vulkan 1.3 API.
- VULKAN: Check validation layers and debug messenger relationship. (According to khronos, this is valid to create the debug messenger without validation layers)
- VULKAN: Fix texture loading. (UINT → UNORM) Convert data before? or not?
- VULKAN: Use of a separated image from a sampler in GLSL when useful.
- VULKAN: Find a better solution to handle shared uniform buffer objects.
- VULKAN: Find a better way to create and store a descriptor set layout.
- VULKAN: Find a way to order the rendering by pipeline layout to reduce the binding cost per draw. See VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering from Vulkan 1.1 API extension, upgraded in Vulkan 1.2 API and core in Vulkan 1.3 API.
- VULKAN: Check for the right way to push constant from the right shader declaration to the right stage in vulkan. (GraphicsShaderGenerator.cpp:254)
- VULKAN: Analyze UBO and instanced VBO usage and make a better and global shared UBO/VBO optimization for short life entity.
